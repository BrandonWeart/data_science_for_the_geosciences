    "# Homework 3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Climate Toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Due: TBD\n",
    "\n",
    "### Directions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Change the name of your notebook to Homework3_FirstLast.ipynb, where First is your first name and Last is your last name.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each of the following prompts, write or modify Python code that fulfills the requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important information to remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Periodically, you should click File -> Save Notebook\n",
    "2. When you are done working for the day, click File -> Log Out\n",
    "3. When you are finished, download the notebook and upload it to the submission link\n",
    "\n",
    "# Extra requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this homework assignment, you will be using functions to calculate a number of climate-related statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The following statistics will be calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Climate Normal - Sum up all of the available annual or monthly data and find the mean based on the number of years in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Climate frequencies - Count how often something occurs based on a condition / test\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Climate extremes - find the maximum and minimum values for a climate variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### You have calculated these statistics in the \"old\" way. I will require you to calculate them using the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you have a list or dictionary of values, you *must* use an iterator and a for loop that is appropriate for the particular data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You must implement the following helper functions: \"sum\", \"mean\", \"minimum\", and \"maximum\" function. What do I mean by implement? This is the process of brainstorming, designing, and then finally writing the Python code that performs specific tasks. These functions *do* exist as basic \"built-in\" Python functions (as well as functions that are in other Python packages), but you must create them yourself in this assignment. This means that each of these functions must take a list or dictionary (this will be specified), loop through each value, and then at each iteration, perform some calculation or test that leads to the correct result. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Again, you cannot use ```sum()```, ```len()```, ```min()```, ```max()``` or any ```list``` functions such as ```sort()```, etc., unless otherwise specified. You cannot use numpy, etc. \n",
    "    - If you have any questions about if you are appropriately following directions, talk to me. Ignorance is not an excuse.\n",
    "    - Violating the requirements will immediately result in 0 points for that particular function / problem. \n",
    "    - The \"philosophy\" of this homework assignment is to use functions, loops, and if statements to manually implement common calculations. If you try to turn in work that takes a shortcut, loophole, etc., that undermines this philosophy, you will get no credit. This is because you are not practicing the concepts we are talking about in class at the moment. \n",
    "    - There will be no exceptions to this requirement and no \"asking for points back\" if you exploit a perceived loophole in my description that allows you to avoid actually practicing using concepts in the current material.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. I will be using the \"built-in\" Python and list functions to test your functions for accuracy. You can see why this would make violations of #2 a pointless exercise on your part, and a waste of time for everyone involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The functions must provide the correct values. I will provide \"answers\" for specific test cases in a code block. The correct values **must be derived from your code. You cannot just place the \"correct\" answer as a float or int and get a point**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the correct answer is 2, and you create a function like this\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def my_func(x):\n",
    "\n",
    "    # your incorrect / not working code\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will receive 0 points. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Do not use generative AI to complete the problems below. I have included requirements and phrases that will make it obvious that you just copy and pasted the code from ChatGPT, etc. You can use google or ChatGPT to troubleshoot (\"Why am I getting this error?\") but you cannot generate code and use it in this assignment."

You will not be able to rewrite and test all of the code in a reasonable amount of time. Thus, the **only** option is to work within the existing framework. If you disagree with how that framework works, you need to bring it up with your division manager or become the division manager :)"
