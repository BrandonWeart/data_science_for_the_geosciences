    "# For loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Like while loops, for loops will execute an indented code block as long as a condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "The useful aspect of for loops is that this logic does not need to be explicitly determined by the coder. And, you can avoid infinite loops!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic ```for``` loop syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in my_list:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    # do something with i\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each for loop has 3 major components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ```iterable```: a data type that is able to interface with a ```for``` loop and has multiple values within it. \n",
    "2. ```iteration```: each step in the loop, where the ```iteration``` variable set by the programmer is modified based on values in the ```iterable```.\n",
    "3. ```iterator```: the mechanism that works behind the scenes to set values and determine if the loop should continue\n",
    "\n",
    "The preconditions for a ```for``` loop require an ```iterable``` data type. These types include (but are not limited to):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ```list```\n",
    "2. ```tuple```\n",
    "3. ```dict```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these composite data types are considered ```iterable```, which is just a fancy way of saying that they contain multiple items and a for loop can automatically serve up each item that it contains. For example, an ```int``` is not an ```iterable``` because it is only one value, but a list of ```int``` variables within a ```list``` can be served to a ```for``` loop through the ```list``` that contains these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step of the loop (i.e., each time the indented code block is executed) is called an ```iteration```. During an ```iteration```, the value served by the for loop changes in the order the values appear in the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following list (which is an ```iterable```):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Would serve to the ```for``` loop the value 1 during the first ```iteration```. The second ```iteration``` would serve the value 2, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```iterator``` is the magic that occurs in the background of a for loop that does multiple things for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It checks to see if there are more items to visit in the ```iterable```. If not, the loop ends\n",
    "\n",
    "2. During each ```iteration```, it accesses the values in the ```iterable``` at each index in the order in which they appear. The ```iterator``` then sets this value equal to a variable that is named by the programmer that can be used in the current ```iteration```\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the above ```for``` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in my_list:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    # do something with i\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The equivalent process can be explicitly demonstrated by a ```while``` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "index = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while (index < len(my_list)):\n",
    "\n",
    "    i = my_list[index]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # do something with i\n",
    "    \n",
    "    index = index + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the extra steps in the ```while``` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. setting an ```index``` variable to 0 to start at the beginning of the list\n",
    "2. determining a condition (i.e., ```index < len(my_list```) when the loop should stop\n",
    "3. accessing each value in the list based on the ```index``` variable and setting it equal to i\n",
    "4. incrementing the ```index``` by 1 to visit the next item in the list, or to cause the ```while``` loop condition to result in False and stop the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for most cases, we would want to use a ```for``` loop to avoid all of the potential pitfalls and bugs that could pop up when using a ```while``` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of the ```for``` and ```while``` loops above.\n",
    "\n",
    "```while``` loop:"
