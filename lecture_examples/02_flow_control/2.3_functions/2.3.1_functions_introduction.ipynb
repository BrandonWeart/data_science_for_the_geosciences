    "3) **(F):** - immediately after the function name, you see parentheses with text inside it. These are called *arguments* or *parameters*. \n",
    "4) *arguments* or *parameters* - these are variables that are *only* available within the function, but are required for the function to run properly. You can have no arguments ( ```funct_name()``` ) or many arguments that are separated by commas ( ```funct_name(a, b, c, d, e, f)```).\n",
    "5) *indented code* - the indented code places code within the *scope* of the function. In other words, all indented code \"belongs\" to the function.\n",
    "6) **return K** - also indented, so it belongs to the function. This line returns the result of the function back to where it was \"called\". In this case, it returns the variable \"K\" and the value to which it was set.\n",
    "7) **temperatureK = F_to_K(temperatureF)** - the right side of this equation is an example of \"calling\" a function. The function call requires you to correctly name a defined function ( ```F_to_K```) and to provide it with the required *argument or arguments* (also called parameter or parameters). In this case, ```temperatureF``` is used to set the value of the *argument* variable named F. In this case, F is now set to 56.78 immediately when the function is called. For all indented code, ```F = 56.78``` is now available to use just like if you explicitly defined it that way. The left side of the equation is set equal to the result from **return K**"
