    "\n",
    "The ```class``` provides a template that all humans share (a name and an age), but do not define ```Age``` and ```Name``` until you create an ```instance```.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. self - This is how you access properties and methods **within** the class. In other words, if you want to set or access a property from another part of the class, you must use ```self``` to access that information with dot notation. This always has to be an argument in this method.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The ```self``` argument does not need to be set by the programmer when creating an instance. This is implicitly defined when you create an ```instance```.\n",
