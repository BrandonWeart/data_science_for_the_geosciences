    "The function ```multiply``` is only partially completed. Replace the blanks with correct and working Python code to define the function and complete the task. For the ```range``` function, you must use ```list_name``` to determine how many times you will run the loop. Answers like ```range(5)``` will not receive credit. This is because I could change the size of the ```list``` in the grader and your code would not work with a ```list``` that does not have 5 values. You can use a built-in Python function for this task. Similarly, you must use ```number``` in your multiplication step and you cannot use a \"hard coded\" integer or float in its place.\n",
