    "# numpy\n",

    "### Due: TBD\n",
    "\n",
    "### Directions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Change the name of your notebook to EX5_FirstLast.ipynb, where First is your first name and Last is your last name.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each of the following prompts, write or modify Python code that fulfills the requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important information to remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Periodically, you should click File -> Save Notebook\n",
    "2. When you are done working for the day, click File -> Log Out\n",
    "3. When you are finished, download the notebook and upload it to the submission link\n",
    "\n",
    "# Extra requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following problems using ```numpy```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the last cell to see if you completed the problems correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"numpy array\" is how this assignment will refer to the ```np.ndarray``` data type. A Python ```list``` is not a numpy array. When required to do so by directions or basic numpy functionality, you must convert a list into a numpy array using what we learned in class. This might not always be specified, but it may be implied because it may be difficult or impossible to run ```numpy``` operations on a ```list```.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am banning the use of any for or while loop in this exercise (aside from my grading code at the end of the assignment and the wrapped C++/C/Cython for or while loop calls used by numpy, jupyter / etc. in the background, for all the jokesters out there who will claim that the homework assignment is technically impossible without loops).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your answer must be derived from the requested calculations. If you set values \"manually\", you will get no credit. This is because all of the results are in the grading code below. This is like when the answers are in the back of the book. I'm not interested to see how well you can copy and paste.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I ask you to add 1 to ```x``` and set the variable named ```y``` to the result. This is what I am expecting:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = x + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you instead do something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 11\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will get no credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "Cast the ```list``` named ```a1``` to a numpy array and set a variable named ```n1``` to the result."
